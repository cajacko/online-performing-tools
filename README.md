# Online Performing Tools

Here you'll find a collection of various hacks and programming wizardry that experiments with different ways of performing online. Most of the tools you'll find here relate to performing improvised comedy online, but all aspects of online performing are welcome if you want to contribute.

## Tools

- [Replace web videos with you camera feed](packages/replace-with-video-extension/README.md) ([@cajacko](http://github.com/cajacko))
  - Description: A chrome extension that replaces any YouTube videos that are playing with your camera feed
  - Status: Not published to the chrome store but works if you build locally

## Contributing

All pull requests are welcome in any programming languages (or just documentation if you like). We only have a few requirements:

- All projects should like in `~/packages/project-name` replacing project name with the name of your project in kebab case
- All projects should have a `README.md` file at `~/packages/project-name/README.md` with basic info about the project and how people can use it or help build it
- All projects should be listed in the [Tools](#tools) section of this `README.md` file. Follow the format:

```markdown
- [Project name](packages/project-name/README.md) ([@github_username](http://github.com/github_username))
  - Description: 1 line description of the project
  - Status: The current status it is in e.g. can run locally, published to here etc..
```
