# Replace web videos with you camera feed

A chrome extension that replaces any YouTube videos that are playing with your camera feed. The performing idea is that you would be live sharing your screen and going through YouTube videos based on comment suggestions from your audience, kinda GoggleBox style. But every YouTube video you go to will instead show your camera feed, so you as the improviser will improvise the content of that YouTube video.

## Installation

At the moment we only have a local installation, by cloning this repo, `cd` to this dir, run
`yarn install && yarn build` and then follow the Chrome steps
[here](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted) pointing the installation location as the
`build` folder in this directory.
