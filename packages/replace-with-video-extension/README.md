# Checklist Chrome Extension

Chrome extension that loads the checklists in this repo as a web app within a popup in Chrome.

## Installation

At the moment we only have a local installation, by cloning this repo, `cd` to this dir, run
`yarn install && yarn build` and then follow the Chrome steps
[here](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted) pointing the istallation location as the
`build` folder in this directory.

Don't think anyone else will use this, so meh.
